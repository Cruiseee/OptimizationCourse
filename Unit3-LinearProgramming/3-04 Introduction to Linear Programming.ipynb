    "##Definition and Use\n",
    "__Linear programming__ is used to solve optimization problems where all the constraints, as well as the objective function, are linear equalities or inequalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The methods were first developed in 1939 and used in military planning operations in World War 2. They were refined and published in 1947 by George Dantzig, who called his method the \"Simplex Method.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In lesson 1, you solved a linear programming problem (experienced and inexperienced workers) using a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few lessons you will learn to solve linear programming problems using matrices. Matrices have the following big advantages:\n",
    "1. Can solve problems in more than 2-3 variables (beyond our ability to graph)\n",
    "2. Can be programmed into a computer\n",
    "\n",
    "##Setting Constraints\n",
    "One of the problems that needs to be dealt with is that without a graph, systems of inequalities can be difficult to solve. \n",
    "\n",
    "These were the constraints on the \"workers\" problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align*} \n",
    "15x_1 + 10x_2 &≤ 1200\\qquad(hourly~wages) \\\\\n",
    "1x_1 + 2x_2 &≤ 120\\qquad(supervisor~time) \\\\\n",
    "x_1, x_2 &≥ 0\\qquad(positive~variables)\n",
    "\\end{align*}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of all the inequalities, it is very difficult to find the solution set without a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step, therefore, is to convert inequality constraints to equality constraints. \n",
    "In the example, the inequality \n",
    "$15x_1 + 10x_2 ≤ 1200$\n",
    "implies that there is a difference (possibly 0) between the expression $15x_1 + 10x_2$ and the number $1200$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we introduce a variable (called a \"slack variable\") to represent that difference:\n",
    "$15x_1 + 10x_2 +x_3 = 1200$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "$15x_1 + 10x_2 ≤ 1200$ becomes \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad 15x_1 + 10x_2 +x_3 = 1200$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $1x_1 + 2x_2 ≤ 120$ becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\qquad 1x_1 + 2x_2 + x_\\color{red}{4}= 120$\n",
    "                \n",
    "The two ≥ constraints are not converted, but it is assumed that all variables are positive."
