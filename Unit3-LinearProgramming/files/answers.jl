###Answer A
1. 3c + 4k &le; 24    (c = number of batches of cookies; k = number of cakes)
2. 20b<sub>1</sub> + 12b<sub>2</sub> &ge; 100   (b<sub>1</sub> = number of box 1, b<sub>2</sub> = number of box 2)
3. 4b + 9r + 14w &le;  45 (b = number of miles biking, r = number of miles running, w = number of miles walking)

Some things to watch out for: 

* Make sure variables are phrased in terms of *number of*. People are often tempted to abbreviate `c = cookies`, which looks great until they try to read the constraint and come up with \"3 cookies plus four cakes is less than 24,\" which makes no sense. It's 3 times the *number of batches* of cookies. It's a pain in the rear but saves grief later.

* Note that the object or factor described by all the numbers is invisible in the constraint. In 1, the whole example is about flour, but nothing in the constraint refers to \"flour\"; it has disappeared. Similarly in the answer to 2 there are no \"books\" and in 3 there are no \"minutes.\" This gets really confusing for some people, who will often want to variable-ize flour, books, or minutes.

###Finding the Slope
To find the slope, the easiest way is to set f = 0 and solve for x<sub>2</sub> / x<sub>1</sub>. 

Maybe you'd rather just plug in the corner points. But sometimes you have an objective function that is a curve and not a line. In that case, the optimal value of the objective function will occur on a boundary line but not necessarily at a corner point. To solve, you would graph the curve of the objective function and drag it in the direction of increasing `f` (kind of like making a contour map) and find the last place the objective function contacts the feasible region. That will be the location of the maximum.
""", "Why find the slope?", false)

ans301C = Revealable("""
###Answer C
The corner points were (0, 0), (0, 60), (80, 0) and (30, 60).
1. f = 10x<sub>1</sub> + 9x<sub>2</sub>; maximized at (30, 60) with f = 840. The company should hire 30 experienced and 60 inexperienced workers for 840 tasks per minute.
2. f = 3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub>; maximized at (80, 0) with f = 240. The company should hire 80 experienced and 0 inexperienced workers for 240 customers per year.

Don't forget to write, or at least think about, the meaning of the points rather than just the numerical values.

In C1, both constraints were active. In C2, only the \"money\" constraint was active.
""", "Answer", false)

ans301E = Revealable("""
###Answer E
1. If money is active and supervision is inactive, then by increasing the amount of money available for wages, you could increase the value of `f`. At the same time, you have extra supervisor time. They could take on extra duties or perhaps you could reduce one to part-time.

2. If supervision is active and money inactive, then you might consider hiring another supervisor. You will have extra money in your wage allocation; this might be used to hire that supervisor, or perhaps offer bonuses, or just put in savings.

3. If both constraints are active, then you would have to increase both wage allocation and supervisor availability to increase the value of `f`.

1. [.09 .16 -.09; .55 -.29 .45; -.09 .09 .09]
2. Yikes! Giant error! This has no inverse. Any matrix with a determinant of 0 is not invertible, but that's not really important here, it's just cool.
3. This is kind of a lot at once. First, you need to translate the coefficient matrix into a matrix A (being careful to correctly place 0's), then abbreviate this system as AX = B, then use inverses to find X = A<sup>-1</sup>B. At this point, it's a Julia problem. The answer is 2, 0 , -1, 5.

Remember how painful it is to solve systems of equations by hand? Getting a computer to do it for you is a HUGE time-saver. Plus, computers don't forget negative signs or lose track of what step they're on.

###Answer G
My version of the program has an interesting feature that you may or may not have come up with on their own: a variable called `primeness`, which is set to `true` unless/until the number divides evenly. There are lots of different ways to deal with the issue of how to report `n` as prime. As long as the program has output in words that tells whether the number is prime, consider yourself correct. Nevertheless, the idea of a binary variable is a useful one, so if you struggled, you might want go back and modify your program.

For an extension to the extension, list out the factors of the non-prime numbers. For an extension, list out the factors as factor pairs rather than an ordered list.

    function prime(n)
        primeness = true  # assumes the number is prime until proven otherwise
