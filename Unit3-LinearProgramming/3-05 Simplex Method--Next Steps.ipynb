    "<img src=\"files/3-5/zero.png\" width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to improve the value of $f$, we need to choose a better point than (0, 0). This will involve changing the variables in the basis: we need to exchange one of the slack variables for a \"real\" variable. \n",

    "<img src=\"files/3-5/upfromzero.png\" width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "###Changing the Basis: Pivoting\n",
    "In order for a number to be in the basis, it must have a single number and the rest 0's in its column. This can be attained using the same rules used while pivoting in reduced row-echelon solving:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You may multiply or divide any row by any number\n",
    "2. You may replace any row with the sum of itself and another row, or any multiple thereof.\n",
    "  The process is still called \"pivoting.\"<br /><br />\n",
    "In addition, there are a few new rules:\n",
    "3. The pivot row must be used in all row-replacement operations. Otherwise you will accidentally lose some basis variables. \n",
    "4. The \"answer\" column must always remain positive except in the last row. In the last row, the coefficient of $f$ must always remain positive. This prevents us from accidentally discarding potential pivots later on. (If you get an illegal negative you can multiply the whole row by -1.) \n",
    "5. It is not advisable, except when using a computer, to generate any fractions through division, including dividing the pivot row by the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to pivot this tableau around the value in red:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccccc}\n",
