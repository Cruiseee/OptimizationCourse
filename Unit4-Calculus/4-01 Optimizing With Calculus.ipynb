    "Many of the programs written in the first two units could have been done (in most cases, done better) with calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples are:\n",
    "* finding function zeroes using secant method (when Newton's method is better)\n",
    "* guessing at the limiting slope for sawtooth method (versus finding it with derivatives)\n",
    "* finding maximum and minimum values (without referencing derivatives or second derivatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit, we will be revisiting many of these ideas using calculus as a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we will be extending calculus concepts into higher dimensions (i.e., more than one variable) and applying that to find maxima and minima in 3D or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Challenges With Calculus\n",
    "The biggest challenge with programming a computer to \"do\" calculus is that computers are not abstract thinkers. They can do operations on numbers very quickly, but do not understand functions as an abstract concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $4^2$ makes perfect sense to a computer.\n",
