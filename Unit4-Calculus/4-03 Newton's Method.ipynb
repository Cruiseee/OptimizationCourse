    "Finding the root (also known as zero, $x$-intercept, or solution) of a function is important in a lot of ways. Not only does it enable us to solve any graphable equation, it also has applications in calculus because there is meaning behind a derivative that is equal to zero. \n",

    "The only reason we needed two points in the secant method was to get the slope of a line so we could find its equation. But with calculus you can find the slope of the line with only one point. This, of course, is known as a derivative.\n",

    "2. Find the derivative at that point and use the resulting slope, plus the $x$ and $y$ value of the point, to write the equation of the tangent line.\n",
