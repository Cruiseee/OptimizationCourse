    "##Approximating Integrals\n",
    "In Calculus, you learned two basic ways to approximate the value of an integral:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Reimann sums*: rectangle areas with heights calculated at the left side, right side, or midpoint of each interval\n",
    "<img>\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Trapezoidal sums*: areas of trapezoids formed at each interval\n",
    "<img>\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these cases, the area approximation got better as the width of the intervals decreased. This led to the concept of an integral as the limit of the area as the partition width tends toward zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the areas of a zillion rectangles sounds like something a computer could do really well (and it is), but there's an even better way.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Simpson's Rule\n",
    "Simpson's Rule, named after Thomas Simpson though also used by Kepler a century before, was a way to approximate integrals without having to deal with lots of narrow rectangles (which also implies lots of decimal calculations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Its strength is that, although rectangles and trapezoids work better for linear functions, Simpson's Rule works quite well on curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpson's Rule is based on the fact that given any three points, you can find the equation of a quadratic through those points. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you had points $(3, 12)$, $(1, 5)$, and $(5, 9)$. \n",
    "Starting with $(3, 12)$ and using $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, you could write: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "12 &= a(3)^2 + b(3) + c \\\\\n",
    "12 &= 9a + 3b + c\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "\n",
    "You could do the same thing with the other two points as well, getting:\t\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "5 &= a + b + c \\\\\n",
    "9 &= 25a + 5b + c\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you could solve this system of equations for $a$, $b$, and $c$, and get the equation of the quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"right\" \\>\n",
    "If you're curious, the system of equations solves to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "a &= -1.25 \\\\\n",
    "b &= 8.5 \\\\\n",
    "c &= -2.25\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives the quadratic $y = -1.25x^2 + 8.5x – 2.25$, whose graph is shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, because quadratics are easy to integrate, you could just integrate the quadratic over the interval. It ends up being a very good approximation, but it's also a lot of arithmetic!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there's a nice shortcut. It turns out that the integral of the quadratic over the interval $[a, b]$ always comes out to \n",
    "\n",
    "${{b-a}\\over{6}} \\cdot \\left( f(a)+4f(m)+f(b)\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f(a)$, $f(m)$ and $f(b)$ were the values of the original function at $a$, $m$, and $b$. You don't need the quadratic at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's say you have a function $f(x)$ that you need to integrate over the interval $[2, 12]$. The midpoint of this interval is $x = 7$, which gives us three $x$ values: 2, 7 and 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to evaluate the function at these $x$ values; suppose it gives $(2, 10)$, $(7, -3)$ and $(12, -8)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Simpson's Rule, the integral can be approximated using: $\\begin{align}\n",
    "{{12-2}\\over{6}} \\cdot \\left( f(2)+4f(7)+f(12)\\right) &= \\\\\n",
    "{{10}\\over{6}} \\cdot \\left(10+4(-3) + (-8)\\right) &= \\\\\n",
    "{{5}\\over{3}} \\cdot (-10) &= \\color{blue}{{-50}\\over{3}}\n",
    "\\end{align}$.\n",
