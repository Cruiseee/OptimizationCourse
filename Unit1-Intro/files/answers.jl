1. In order from left to right: (3.9, 18.21), (4, 19), (4.1, 19.81). Increases right, decreases left.

2. (1, 15), (2, 17), (3, 35). Increases right, decreases left

1. Points should be: (0, 0) (0.6, -2.04) (1.2, -3.36) (1.8, -3.96) (2.4, -3.84). The interval/answer is bolded.

2. (2, -4) (2.5, -6.125) This is going the wrong direction; change step to -0.5. [If you didn't pay attention, you got the minimum, around 3.] Complete answer: (2, -4) (1.5, -1.375) (1, 1) (.5, 2.375) (0, 2)

###Answer C
Answers will vary greatly depending on starting \$x\$, starting \$h\$, and how you increment \$h\$ (Fibonacci numbers are only a suggestion).

Make sure you are beginning with a small \$h\$ (at most 0.5). It will ramp up fairly quickly as you increase its value.

1. The local maximum is at \$x = -8.6852\$. Note that this cubic is unbounded on both left and right so if you choose a starting \$x\$ greater than 12 or so, your numbers will fly off to infinity.

2. This function has a few local minima past -12, but as long as you choose an \$x\$-value greater than -11 or so, you should reach the absolute minimum at around \$x = 2.75172\$.

__Iteration__ is when the same procedure is repeated multiple times.


Some examples were long division, the Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers, and the calculator game. Some of these used recursion as well, but not all of them.

It has to be a function, otherwise getting the first two numbers in the output is a real pain.

###Answer G
My version of the program has an interesting feature that you may or may not have come up with on their own: a variable called `primeness`, which is set to `true` unless/until the number divides evenly. There are lots of different ways to deal with the issue of how to report `n` as prime. As long as the program has output in words that tells whether the number is prime, consider yourself correct. Nevertheless, the idea of a binary variable is a useful one, so if you struggled, you might want go back and modify your program.

For an extension to the extension, list out the factors of the non-prime numbers. For an extension, list out the factors as factor pairs rather than an ordered list.

    function prime(n)
        primeness = true  # assumes the number is prime until proven otherwise
        test = 2  # starting with 2 as the divisor
        while test <= sqrt(n)  # ending when we get over the square root of n
            if n % test == 0  # if no remainder, then...
                primeness = false  # the number is not prime.
            end
            test = test + 1  # increments the divisor by 1 -- there are fancier ways
        end
        if primeness  # here we see the `primeness` variable used to generate an output
            println(\"\$n is prime.\")
        else 
            println(\"\$n is not prime.\")
