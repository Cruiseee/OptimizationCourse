# Optimization Course Information
##Course Outline
1. Introductions and Skills
  * Optimization, vectors, iteration and recursion, foundational programming skills
2. Non-calculus methods without constraints
  * Methods in two dimensions using computers; extension to methods in three or more dimensions
3. Non-calculus methods with constraints
  * Linear programming
4. Calculus methods without constraints
  * Newton’s method and review of derivative meaning; derivatives in 3D and above with implications for optimization
5. Calculus methods with constraints
  * Penalty functions; overview of other methods; Lagrange multipliers

##Audience
* First three units: math content around Algebra 1 level, analytical skills approaching Calculus. Students at the Pre-Calculus level should feel comfortable. Skilled, motivated students in Algebra 1 can certainly give it a shot.
* Last two units: Calculus required – know how to take derivatives and be familiar with their implications for finding maxima and minima.
* Computer programming skills will be taught from the ground up. Previous experience is not necessary.

##Credits
These notebooks began as curriculum developed by Julia Roberts, a mathematics teacher at Cupertino High School in San Jose. The curriculum was modified and adapted into notebooks by Renee Trochet, a mathematics teacher at Eastside College Prep in East Palo Alto. This series of lessons was created with support from Professor Mykel Kochenderfer at Stanford University, under a grant from the National Science Foundation through the IISME (Industry Initiatives for Science and Math Education) program.
