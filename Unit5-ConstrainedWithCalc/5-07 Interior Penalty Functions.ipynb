    "##Initial Steps\n",
    "A second type of penalty function begins with an initial point inside the feasible region, which is why these procedures are called __interior penalty functions__ or \"barrier methods.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning, all constraints must be converted into $(expression) ≤ 0$ form.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method will not work with equality constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Barrier Functions\n",
    "The simplest interior penalty function, called an __inverse barrier function__, involves writing a barrier function for each constraint $g_j(x) ≤ 0$ as follows:\n",
    "\t$$B(x) = \\frac{−1}{g_j(x)}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "This procedure has two effects:\n",
    "* The negative sign changes the constraint from a negative number ($≤ 0$) to a positive.\n",
    "* The fraction ensures that as $g_j(x)$ approaches the constraint boundary at 0, the barrier function gets infinitely large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this barrier creates a positive number that approaches infinity as $x$ nears the boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Problems with Barriers\n",
    "As with exterior penalty functions, the inverse barrier method causes some graphical problems. Because it involves an inverse function 1/g(x), it creates an asymptotic graph:\n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-7/asymptote.png\" width=300 />\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as we stay on the left side of the barrier, the method will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-7/rightpiece.png\" width=100 align=\"left\" />If the initial point ever moves outside the boundary, however, the method will fail, because outside the constraint (in this case, the right side of the graph) the other side of the function will come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values here are lower, so a minimization program will pick them up and run with them, even though they violate the constraint.\n",
    "<br clear=\"all\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "##The Solution: $r$, again!\n",
    "As with exterior penalty functions, part of the solution is to include a multiplier, in this case $\\frac{1}{r}$. We will begin with $r = 1$ and gradually increase $r$ by factors of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the effect of successively reducing the penalty. In the beginning the penalty is large, preventing the minimum point from crossing the barrier of the constraint. This barrier is so effective that the minimum point will not be very accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the penalty gets smaller, the minimum point will approach closer to the boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Writing the Penalty Function\n",
    "Using our previous example, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$minimize~f(x) = \\frac{100}{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "subject to $x ≤ 5$\n",
    "\n",
    "we will first convert the constraint to $x – 5 ≤ 0$,\n",
    "\n",
    "then write the barrier function:\n",
    "\t$$B(x) = \\frac{−1}{x−5}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "and then the modified objective function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$minimize~T(x) = \\frac{100}{x} + \\frac{1}{r} \\cdot \\frac{−1}{x−5}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "##Final Steps\n",
    "Finally, we will choose a point *__within the feasible region__* as our starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we can use a step minimizer to minimize the function with $r = 1$; then, using that answer as the next starting point, minimize again with $r = 10$, and so on."
