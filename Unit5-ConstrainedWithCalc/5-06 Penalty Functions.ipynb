I personally don't like over-medicating my patients (maybe this is why I'm a math teacher) so my action would be to wait a week and do nothing.\\n3. If they're still sneezing after waiting a week, my belief state would become: allergies 80%, cold 15%, <other> 5%.\\n4. They could get really insightful here. I would ask a lot of questions trying to eliminate the \\\"other\\\" hypothesis and narrow it down to cold or allergies, and then I would try to narrow it between those (is it seasonal? what seasons? do you work with small children? is your family sick?). I would try more wait time which would hopefully give a cold time to pass on, and then see if allergy meds helped. If they did, then there's the answer. If they didn't, then I would conclude that while allergies are still possible they are much less probable. At some point \\\"cold\\\" and \\\"allergies\\\" would both be so improbable I'd have to look deeper into the \\\"other\\\" option and maybe expand my state possibilities beyond three.\\n\\nYou gain a lot of insight into medicine by thinking of doctors as POMDP systems.

    "##The Premise\n",
    "You may have noticed that the addition of constraints to an optimization problem has the effect of making it much more difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of __penalty functions__ is to convert constrained problems into unconstrained problems by introducing an artificial penalty for violating the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this example: Suppose there is a freeway (like a toll freeway) that monitors when you enter and exit the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of establishing a speed limit of 65 mph, they could use these rules:\n",
    "* You can drive as fast as you want.\n",
    "* If you drive under 65 mph you can use our road for free.\n",
    "* Every mph you drive over 65 will cost you \\$500.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous example had no constraints – you can drive as fast as you want! But the effect of these rules would still be to limit drivers to 65mph. You can also control the likelihood of speeding by adjusting the fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Penalty functions work in exactly this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Initial Steps\n",
    "We will be working with a very simple example: \n",
    "\n",
    "\tminimize $f(x) = 100/x$\n",
    "    \n",
    "\tsubject to $x ≤ 5$\n",
    "    \n",
    "(With a little thought, you can tell that $f(x)$ will be minimized when $x = 5$, so we know what answer we should get!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, convert any constraints into the form $(expression) ≤ 0$. In this example, $x ≤ 5$ becomes:\n",
    "$$x – 5 ≤ 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your constraints are converted, the next step is to start charging a penalty for violating them. Since we're trying to minimize $f(x)$, this means we need to __add__ value when the constraint is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are trying to maximize, the penalty will __subtract__ value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Quadratic Loss: Inequalities\n",
    "With the constraint $x – 5 ≤ 0$, we need a penalty that is: \n",
    "* 0 when $x – 5 ≤ 0$  \t\t(the constraint is satisfied)\n",
    "* positive when $x – 5 > 0$ \t(the constraint is violated)\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done using the operation \n",
    "\t$$P(x) = max(0, x – 5)$$\n",
    "which returns the maximum of the two values, either $0$ or whatever $(x – 5)$ is.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make the penalty more severe by using \n",
    "\t$$P(x) = max(0, x – 5)^2$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "This is known as a __quadratic loss function__.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Quadratic Loss: Equalities\n",
    "It is even easier to convert equality constraints into quadratic loss functions because we don’t need to worry about the operation $(max, g(x))$. We can convert $h(x) = c$ into $h(x) – c = 0$, then use\n",
    "\t$$P(x) = (h(x) – c)^2$$\n",
    "    \n",

    "##The Next Step\n",
    "Once you have converted your constraints into penalty functions, the basic idea is to add all the penalty functions (usually called $T(x)$) on to the original objective function and minimize from there:\n",

    "In our example,\n",
    "\n",
    "minimize $T(x) = 100/x + max(0, x – 5)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "##A Problem\n",
    "But it isn't quite that easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of penalty functions can create severe slope changes in the graph at the boundary, which interferes with typical minimization programs.\n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-6/steepslope.png\" width=150 />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are two simple changes that will alleviate this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "##First Solution: $r$\n",
    "The first is to multiply the quadratic loss function by a constant, $r$. This controls how severe the penalty is for violating the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-6/r.png\" width=50 align=\"left\" />\n",
    "The accepted method is to start with r = 10, which is a mild penalty. It will not form a very sharp point in the graph, but the minimum point found using r = 10 will not be a very accurate answer because the penalty is not severe enough.<br clear=\"all\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-6/rnarrows.png\" width=50 align=\"left\" />\n",
    "Then, $r$ is increased to 100 and the function minimized again starting from the minimum point found when $r$ was 10. The higher penalty increases accuracy, and as we narrow in on the solution, the sharpness of the graph is less of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue to increase $r$ values until the solutions converge.<br clear=\"all\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "##Second Solution: Methods\n",
    "The second solution is to be thoughtful with how we minimize. The more useful minimization programs written in Unit 2 were interval methods. The program started with an interval and narrowed it in from the endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-6/intervals.png\" width=300 />\n",
    "\n",
    "With a severe nonlinearity, interval methods have a tendency to skip right over the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, interval methods are generally not ideal for penalty functions. It is better to use methods that take tiny steps from a starting point, similar to the \"brute force\" methods we used in 1-variable, or any of the methods we used in 2-variable minimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important when using penalty functions to run the program a few times from various starting points to avoid local extremes."
