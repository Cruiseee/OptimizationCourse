I personally don't like over-medicating my patients (maybe this is why I'm a math teacher) so my action would be to wait a week and do nothing.\\n3. If they're still sneezing after waiting a week, my belief state would become: allergies 80%, cold 15%, <other> 5%.\\n4. They could get really insightful here. I would ask a lot of questions trying to eliminate the \\\"other\\\" hypothesis and narrow it down to cold or allergies, and then I would try to narrow it between those (is it seasonal? what seasons? do you work with small children? is your family sick?). I would try more wait time which would hopefully give a cold time to pass on, and then see if allergy meds helped. If they did, then there's the answer. If they didn't, then I would conclude that while allergies are still possible they are much less probable. At some point \\\"cold\\\" and \\\"allergies\\\" would both be so improbable I'd have to look deeper into the \\\"other\\\" option and maybe expand my state possibilities beyond three.\\n\\nYou gain a lot of insight into medicine by thinking of doctors as POMDP systems.

Each ad campaign in traditional media costs about \\$2000, generating 2 new customers and 1 positive rating per month. Each personal appearance costs \\$500, generating 2 new customers and 5 positive ratings. The company wants at least 16 new customers and 28 positive ratings per month. Minimize the advertising costs for this company.</blockquote>\n",

The pizza shop that figured out how to use their waste cooking oil to power their delivery cars? Pareto improvement. (Well, unless you count the company they used to pay to haul away their used cooking oil.) There was this Wisconsin town that was trying to use cheese byproducts instead of salt on winter roads, finding it less corrosive as well; Iâ€™m guessing it didnâ€™t work, but it would have been a Pareto improvement if it had. Increasing public transit use can be Pareto depending how you increase it (raising taxes to fund subsidies is not).
