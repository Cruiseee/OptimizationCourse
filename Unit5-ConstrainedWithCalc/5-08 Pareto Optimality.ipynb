    "##The Premise\n",
    "In Unit 3 (Linear programming), we learned how to solve problems like this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>A small business advertises through traditional media and personal appearances. Each ad campaign in traditional media costs about \\$2000, generating 2 new customers and 1 positive rating per month. Each personal appearance costs \\$500, generating 2 new customers and 5 positive ratings. The company wants at least 16 new customers and 28 positive ratings per month. Minimize the advertising costs for this company.</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose the company in the previous example used linear programming to minimize costs, and found that their optimal solution was to skip traditional advertising altogether and just make personal appearances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon, the executives would realize that they were spending so much time at personal appearances that they might be tempted to hire another executive – hardly a way to minimize cost!\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of scenario plays out quite often and is called multiobjective optimization. In it, there are two or more objectives (in this case, minimize cost AND time) along with constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently, objectives are confused with constraints when initially framing a problem. \n",
    "For example, do you really only have 4 hours a week to spend doing chores? Or is that just a way of saying you want to minimize time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints should only be used when there is a hard, non-negotiable limit on the resource. "

    "##Pareto Optimality\n",
    "One way to find good solutions to multiobjective problems is with Pareto optimality, named after economist Vilfredo Pareto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pareto noticed that many economic solutions helped some people while hurting others. He was interested in finding solutions that helped some people without hurting anyone else. Solutions like this are now called \"Pareto improvements.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is the conflict between environmental issues and business. Most environmental considerations hurt business, whether it's limits on energy use or waste generated. The pizza shop that figured out how to use their waste cooking oil to power their delivery cars? Pareto improvement. (Well, unless you count the company they used to pay to haul away their used cooking oil.) There was this Wisconsin town that was trying to use cheese byproducts instead of salt on winter roads, finding it less corrosive as well; I’m guessing it didn’t work, but it would have been a Pareto improvement if it had. Increasing public transit use can be Pareto depending how you increase it (raising taxes to fund subsidies is not). Businesses who install fluorescent lights on motion timers to satisfy regulations, then find their energy costs plummeting, have stumbled on an obvious one. \n",
