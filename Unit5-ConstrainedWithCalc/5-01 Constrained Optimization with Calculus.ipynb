I personally don't like over-medicating my patients (maybe this is why I'm a math teacher) so my action would be to wait a week and do nothing.\\n3. If they're still sneezing after waiting a week, my belief state would become: allergies 80%, cold 15%, <other> 5%.\\n4. They could get really insightful here. I would ask a lot of questions trying to eliminate the \\\"other\\\" hypothesis and narrow it down to cold or allergies, and then I would try to narrow it between those (is it seasonal? what seasons? do you work with small children? is your family sick?). I would try more wait time which would hopefully give a cold time to pass on, and then see if allergy meds helped. If they did, then there's the answer. If they didn't, then I would conclude that while allergies are still possible they are much less probable. At some point \\\"cold\\\" and \\\"allergies\\\" would both be so improbable I'd have to look deeper into the \\\"other\\\" option and maybe expand my state possibilities beyond three.\\n\\nYou gain a lot of insight into medicine by thinking of doctors as POMDP systems.

    "##Background Information\n",
    "In Unit 3, you learned about linear programming, in which all constraints and the objective function are linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, frequently situations arise where the constraints, or the objective function, or both, are not linear. In this unit you will learn about some techniques that can be used to minimize functions in this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##The First Big Problem\n",
    "The first big problem is with the objective function. When the objective function was linear, we knew the maximum and minimum values had to occur at a constraint boundary. \n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-1/linear.png\" width=225 />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the objective function is nonlinear, the optimum value can occur anywhere: \n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-1/extrema.png\" width=400 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can't get away with just checking the corners: we have to check all the edges, and the interior as well. (Typically the optimum point occurs at a boundary... but not always!)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that any procedure attempting to minimize with a nonlinear objective function needs to have two components: one that considers the boundaries (including the corners) and one that checks the interior.\n",
    "\n",
    "##The Second Big Problem\n",
    "The second big problem is visualization. Even with only two variables plus an objective function (a three-dimensional situation), nonlinear constraints can be very difficult to visualize.\n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-1/feasreg.png\" width=100 />\n",
    "\n",
    "After the feasible region is graphed, we still have to consider the objective function. But the typical 3D graph distorts the $x$-$y$ plane, which would make it impossible to use our feasible region graph.\n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-1/3dfeasreg.png\" width=400 />\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this is to graph our 3D shape as a contour map and overlay it on the feasible region.\n",
