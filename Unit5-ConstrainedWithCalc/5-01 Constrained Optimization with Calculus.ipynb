    "##Background Information\n",
    "In Unit 3, you learned about linear programming, in which all constraints and the objective function are linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, frequently situations arise where the constraints, or the objective function, or both, are not linear. In this unit you will learn about some techniques that can be used to minimize functions in this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##The First Big Problem\n",
    "The first big problem is with the objective function. When the objective function was linear, we knew the maximum and minimum values had to occur at a constraint boundary. \n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-1/linear.png\" width=225 />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the objective function is nonlinear, the optimum value can occur anywhere: \n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-1/extrema.png\" width=400 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can't get away with just checking the corners: we have to check all the edges, and the interior as well. (Typically the optimum point occurs at a boundary... but not always!)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that any procedure attempting to minimize with a nonlinear objective function needs to have two components: one that considers the boundaries (including the corners) and one that checks the interior.\n",
    "\n",
    "##The Second Big Problem\n",
    "The second big problem is visualization. Even with only two variables plus an objective function (a three-dimensional situation), nonlinear constraints can be very difficult to visualize.\n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-1/feasreg.png\" width=100 />\n",
    "\n",
    "After the feasible region is graphed, we still have to consider the objective function. But the typical 3D graph distorts the $x$-$y$ plane, which would make it impossible to use our feasible region graph.\n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-1/3dfeasreg.png\" width=400 />\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this is to graph our 3D shape as a contour map and overlay it on the feasible region.\n",
    "<img src=\"files/5-1/overlay.png\" width=300 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the maximum or minimum value can be found just by looking at this type of picture."
