ans501A = Revealable("""
###Answer A
1. The feasible region has 5 corner points. On the left side it is bounded mainly by the parabola, though there is a crossing point with the 1/x near the top of the region. The upper left corner is the intersection of 1/x with 10-x; the entire upper bound is the line, and the right boundary is the parabola. The lower boundary is 1/x which crosses the parabola twice, close to x = 3. 
2. The maximum value will likely occur at the right corner (between the parabola and line).<br /><br />
The minimum value will probably occur at the corner closest to the origin, the middle of three crossing points of the parabola with 1/x.<br /><br />
Hopefully two lessons will be learned here: first, this is harder than it seems at first glance, and second, we're really just guessing.

###Answer C
1. -x<sub>2</sub> + e<sup>-x<sub>1</sub></sup> + 2 &le; 0
2. x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - 24 &le; 0

If you graph these all together, it's a four-sided region (the axes do not come into play) bounded left and right by the parabola, top by the circle and bottom by the exponential.
