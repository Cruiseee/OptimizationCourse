###Answer A
1. The feasible region has 5 corner points. On the left side it is bounded mainly by the parabola, though there is a crossing point with the 1/x near the top of the region. The upper left corner is the intersection of 1/x with 10-x; the entire upper bound is the line, and the right boundary is the parabola. The lower boundary is 1/x which crosses the parabola twice, close to x = 3. 
2. The maximum value will likely occur at the right corner (between the parabola and line).<br /><br />
The minimum value will probably occur at the corner closest to the origin, the middle of three crossing points of the parabola with 1/x.<br /><br />
Hopefully two lessons will be learned here: first, this is harder than it seems at first glance, and second, we're really just guessing.

1. Gradient = 0, but the eigenvalues of the Hessian (0 and 0.5 &mdash; you might need some sreview here, I did!) are not both positive. The fact that one is 0 means that this is an indeterminate point. What happened is the objective function is similar to the 2D equation xy = 1, or y = 1/x, which is not differentiable at x = 0.

###Answer C
You might have noticed that your minimum f value pretty much always occurs at the maximum a value (on the constraint), which makes a lot of sense graphically: chances are very small now that the minimum f value will occur in the interior of the feasible region since we already passed through the interior in phase 1 and landed on a constraint. You can shortcut the \"minimizing f\" step as long as you are aware that it is a shortcut which, though rarely, risks returning a wrong answer in the event that there is an interior minimum quite close to the constraint boundary.

###Answer A
'Helpful to graph the feasible region' is more on the order of necessary. I'm using fooplot and graphing the points as I go along to check my work. Julia has lots of graphing packages if you want to do it all in the notebook.<br /><br />
Answers will vary depending on how much you push off in phase 2 and how many iterations you run.<br /><br />
From (1, 3): steepest descent = &lt;4, -6&gt; is feasible (dot product with constraint gradient = -32)<br />
new point = (1 + 4a, 3 - 6a), will impact g<sub>3</sub> at maximum a value of a = 0.3804<br />
minimizing f results in a = 0.3804. **Make sure you minimize `f(a)` in phase 1!**<br />
new point = (2.5214, 0.7177) on g<sub>3</sub>.<br /><br />
From here, I used a couple of programs shown below (absent much documentation &mdash; sorry), in loops like `point = move(point)`, `point = edge(g, point)` to bump out and then move back to the edge. I didn't minimize `f` each time (shortcut! Oh no!). <br /><br />
Progression of points:
        edge                interior
        (1, 3)              n/a (phase 1)

        (2.54828, 0.73117)  etc...

###Answer B
This one is more involved because it will near a corner.<br /><br />
From (1,3) steepest descent is &lt;-2, -1&gt;, which is feasible with dot product -8. This will head towards g<sub>1</sub>. 
However, although the limiting `a` is 0.75, the minimizing `a` is 0.625, which gives an interior point at (-0.25, 2.375).<br /><br />
From (-0.25, 2.375) steepest descent is &lt;0.5, -1&gt; which heads towards g<sub>3</sub>. This time the limiting `a` = 2.153304 ends up being the minimizing `a`, forming a new point at (0.826652, 0.2217).<br /><br />
Points, in order:<br /><br />

        edge                interior
        (1,3)               (-.25, 2.375) minimized f in interior here, phase 1 repeat

        ...

<br /><br />
(-.029729, 0.12245) At this point it gets really near the corner of g<sub>3</sub> and g<sub>1</sub>, so I found the next interior point which is still within the feasible region: (-.0381862, .222092) and checked that against both constraints. Indeed, the max `a` value goes with constraint g<sub>1</sub>, with an edge point of (-.0307, .1236). After some checking against the graph I greatly reduced my push-off value and got to a new point (back on g<sub>3</sub>):<br /><br />

For initial point 2 you should get 3, then for initial point 3, you will get the correct answer of x = 4. 
In 1. the penalty is too large, which causes the minimum at 4 to be caught up in the asymptote and dragged upward to the point where it is no longer even a local minimum.

###Answer F
1. Three is a challenge! I had to look it up. I won't give away the third, but there are a lot of possibilities. I'd be worried if their belief state wasn't something like: allergies 48%, cold 48%, <other> 2%. Make them fill in \"other\", even if they have to look it up too. It was educational.
2. I personally don't like over-medicating my patients (maybe this is why I'm a math teacher) so my action would be to wait a week and do nothing.
3. If they're still sneezing after waiting a week, my belief state would become: allergies 80%, cold 15%, <other> 5%.
4. They could get really insightful here. I would ask a lot of questions trying to eliminate the \"other\" hypothesis and narrow it down to cold or allergies, and then I would try to narrow it between those (is it seasonal? what seasons? do you work with small children? is your family sick?). I would try more wait time which would hopefully give a cold time to pass on, and then see if allergy meds helped. If they did, then there's the answer. If they didn't, then I would conclude that while allergies are still possible they are much less probable. At some point \"cold\" and \"allergies\" would both be so improbable I'd have to look deeper into the \"other\" option and maybe expand my state possibilities beyond three.

You gain a lot of insight into medicine by thinking of doctors as POMDP systems. Probably because they are.
