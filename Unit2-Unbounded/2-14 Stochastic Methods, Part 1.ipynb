    "<img src=\"files/2-14/arrows.png\" width=100 align=\"left\" />Suppose a small target, like a rock or a stick, is placed on a hillside. Many arrows are shot at it. Later the target is removed and the arrows are left. \n",

    "<br clear=\"all\" />\n",
    "Like using randomly-positioned arrows to estimate the position of a target, stochastic methods have the goal of gaining information out of randomness.\n",

    "Stochastic Optimization is used when:\n",
    "* the data or input is random or unpredictable (like how long it takes to travel somewhere)\n",
    "* the input is prone to measurement error (like scientific data from imperfect instruments)\n",
    "* the data or equations are known, but too complex to handle conventionally (like finding the probability of winning at solitaire)\n",
    "\n",
    "All stochastic processes involve a large amount of input or trials; in general, the more trials there are, the more accurate the results will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you're trying to find the probability that an actual coin flips \"heads.\" The best way to do this is by flipping the coin repeatedly and recording the results. This is considered a stochastic process because it involves repeated sampling of essentially random inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason you need a lot of data is that if you flipped a coin just once and it came up \"heads,\" based on the evidence you could conclude that it would always come up \"heads,\" 100% of the time. \n",
