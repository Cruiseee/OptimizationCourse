This is ugly but sufficient.\\n\\nA much more elegant trick is to notice that the sum of the last two intervals is merely the difference between the first and third current points. In my code, the three points were named `x`, `a`, `b`; so I added a line just before the end of the `while` loop saying `h = b - x`.  \\n\\nMy final code, with counter:\\n\\n<code>\\nfunction threept(f, x, int)\\n    a = x + int\\n    if f(a) > f(x)\\n        int = -int \\n        a = x + int \\n    end\\n    b = a + int \\n    iter = 0\\n    while f(b) < f(a)\\n        x = a \\n        a = b \\n        b = b + int \\n        iter = iter + 1\\n        int = b - x  # new line: create Fibonacci incrementation of interval width\\n    end\\n    println(\\\"\\$x, \\$(f(x))\\\")\\n    println(\\\"\\$a, \\$(f(a))\\\")\\n    println(\\\"\\$b, \\$(f(b))\\\")\\n    println(iter)\\nend\\n</code>\\n\", \"Answer\", false, false)"
