       "Revealable(\"###Answer A\\n\\nOne of the tricky things about this task is how much to narrow the interval. I used thirds in my program for speed and convenience, though I worried that thirds might be overly aggressive. There's a possibility that the minimum would occur in the outer third and if I skip over it, I'll end up with an infinite loop in my program. Fortunately infinite loops are easy to identify, and then I would just change my /3 to /4 or /10 or something and repeat.\\n\\nHow did you choose to narrow the interval, and why? \\n<code>\\nfunction findmin(f, leftbound, rightbound)  # Function `f` will need to be pre-loaded. \\n    while rightbound - leftbound > .0001  # This tolerance can be adjusted as needed. Or, add a new defined variable `tolerance`.\\n        slope = (f(rightbound) - f(leftbound))/(rightbound - leftbound)\\n        if slope < 0\\n                leftbound = leftbound + (rightbound - leftbound)/3  # here's that /3 -- modify as needed\\n        elseif slope > 0\\n                rightbound = rightbound - (rightbound - leftbound)/3\\n        else  # In the special case where the slopes are equal it marches both endpoints in. \\n            leftbound = leftbound + (rightbound + leftbound)/3 \\n            rightbound = rightbound - (rightbound + leftbound)/3\\n        end\\n    end\\n    println(\\\"\\$leftbound, \\$rightbound\\\")  # Prints the boundaries, from which you can estimate the location of the minimum\\nend\\n</code>\\n\",\"Answer\",false)"
