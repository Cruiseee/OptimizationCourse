    "<img src=\"files/2-7/unbounded.png\" width=150 />\n",
    "\n",
    "For a function like this one, the most obvious effect is that there is no global maximum because there are no upper boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bigger problem is that it also has no left or right boundaries. Without a graph, or even with a graph, there is no way to know if the point that appears to be the global minimum here actually is a global minimum. Both of the methods we will learn for finding global extremes rely on having some kind of left-right boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, boundaries will naturally occur. An airplane wing can't have negative length, nor can it be a mile long. Although 0 < $x$ < (1 mile) seems like an odd set of boundaries, any boundaries will do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option to solve the unboundedness problem is to introduce an artificial ceiling. This might say, \"If $y$ gets over 1000, I'll assume the function is going to keep going and not ever turn around.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/2-7/vbound.png\" width=200 />\n",
