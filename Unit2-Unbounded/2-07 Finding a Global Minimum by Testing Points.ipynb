Without a graph, or even with a graph, there is no way to know if the point that appears to be the global minimum here actually is a global minimum. Both of the methods we will learn for finding global extremes rely on having some kind of left-right boundaries.\n",

Since you wrote the three earlier programs in separate sittings, you probably have different variables for the same thing in all the different programs. You will have to unify like variables under a common name and separate variables that you accidentally named the same thing but are different. You will also have to maintain attention to the order of interval endpoints if any of the programs require them to be in numerical order.\\n\\nOther than that, it's just a matter of deleting the `function` and `end` commands from the top and bottom of each individual program, then putting a great big `function` and `end` to bracket the whole thing.\\n<code>\\nfunction globalmin(f, a, b)  # f is the function, a and b the endpoints of the interval in order\\n    # This composite function combines a grid search, a 3-point interval, and a slope-based minimization program to find a global minimum.\\n    \\n    # the first part of the program is a grid search to determine a good starting point.\\n    int = b - a\\n    int = int/50  # divides interval into 50 subintervals\\n    test = a  # everything starts with a. Test is the point we're currently testing...\\n    low = f(a)  # low is the record low value so far\\n    save = a  # save is the x-value corresponding to the record low\\n    while test < b  # this loop will run until we've tested all the points from a to b\\n        if f(test)<low  # if the y-value is lower than the current lowest,\\n        low = f(test)  # then this loop replaces the current (save, low) with the new (save, low)\\n        save = test  # save will return the location of the lowest point\\n    end\\n    test = test + int  # moving on to the next point\\n  end\\n\\n    # the next part of the program is a 3-point interval search, using \\\"save\\\" as the seed point, the location of the record low from the grid search\\n    int = int/10  # initial interval is 1/10 the previous interval\\n    a = save + int  # first test point is 1 interval unit from the starting point\\n    if f(a) > f(save)  # this loop checks direction of motion to ensure we're heading to a minimum\\n        int = -int\\n        a = save + int\\n    end\\n    b = a + int\\n    while f(b) < f(a)\\n        save = a  # stepping the interval along\\n        a = b\\n        b = b + int\\n        int = b - save  # this increases the interval width in a Fibonacci pattern.\\n    end\\n  \\n    # finally, the last part of the program minimizes in the interval [save, a].\\n    left = min(b, save)\\n    right = max(b, save)\\n        phi = (-1+(5)^(1/2))/2  # phi, the golden ratio, used for sectioning below.\\n        int = right - left\\n        while int > 0.00001  # tolerance, change as needed\\n            subdiv = phi * int\\n            lefttest = right - subdiv  # this line and the next create two points within the interval...\\n            righttest = left + subdiv\\n            if f(lefttest) < f(righttest)  # ...while this loop tests the interior points in the function and shifts the interval endpoints inward accordingly.\\n            right = righttest\\n        else\\n            left = lefttest\\n        end\\n        int = right - left\\n    end\\n    println(\\\"\\$left, \\$right\\\")\\nend\\n</code>\\n\", \"Answer\", false, false)"
