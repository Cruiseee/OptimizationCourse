    "__Brute force__ is an actual term which implies a very simple procedure repeated a potentially very large number of times. Computers are good at this sort of thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it tends to be true that a small amount of added intelligence greatly reduces the number of iterations. \n",
    "Therefore, \"brute force\" is generally not a compliment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current most-often-heard use of \"brute force\" is in password hacking, where you just try every possible combination until one of them works. This takes a long time."

    "<img src=\"files/2-3/bruteforceint.png\" width=250 />\n",
    "\n",
    "then you can just start at the left endpoint and walk to the right with tiny steps until you find the smallest $y$-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason the interval is important is that I really mean \"tiny steps,\" like $h = 0.0001$ or something&mdash;whatever tolerance the user cares to specify. Students will remember how greatly a small $h$-value affected the number of iterations of the three-point interval loop. Applying a really small $h$ on an entire function would get crazy. With an interval, it's more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
