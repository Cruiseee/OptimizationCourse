    "* First three units: math content around Algebra 1 level, analytical skills approaching Calculus. Students at the Pre-Calculus level should feel comfortable. Skilled, motivated students in Algebra 1 can certainly give it a shot.\n",
    "* Last two units: Calculus required – know how to take derivatives and be familiar with their implications for finding maxima and minima.\n",
    "* Computer programming skills will be taught from the ground up. Previous experience is not necessary. \n"

    "These slides were adapted from a curriculum developed by Julia Roberts, a mathematics teacher at Cupertino High School in San Jose. They were adapted into notebooks by Renee Trochet, a mathematics teacher at Eastside College Prep in East Palo Alto. This series of lessons was created with support from Professor Mykel Kochenderfer at Stanford University, under a grant from the National Science Foundation through the IISME (Industry Initiatives for Science and Math Education) program.
